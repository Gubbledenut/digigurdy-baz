// VERSION 117 with 5th tuning option
// Has louder buzz to work with latest version of FluidSynth on Android phones.
// On bs-16i turn down buzz slider else will be too loud. ADDING EEPROM to
// remember previous settings.   // If you do not already have the EEPROM
// library in Documents--->Arduino----> libraries folder, you can download it
// from here. Put the files into a folder just called EEPROM inside your
// libraries folder.

// Do Re Mi display version, experimental to see what people think. DUAL display
// selector at start. DJ duplicated all usbMIDI lines to MIDI included MIDI.h
// and MIDI serial to allow Teensy 3.6 or 3.5 to output to a serial DIN socket
// as well using the MIDI library EXPERIMENTAL PITCHBEND VERSION. For now
// commented out but it could be used and does work

// DJ Add Serial/Midiout put via 5 pin midi din socket  Teensy Pin 1 TX to  midi
// pin 5 Teensy 3.3V out to midi pin 4

// NOTE:
// To CHANGE TUNING you now press top left and top right keys at same time.
// To enter DEMO MODE you now press left top dark blue button and rightmost
// LOWER button together.

// This stops people accidentally entering Demo mode as happened with the
// earlier system.

// For Digi Nerdy Gurdy there are now 3 extra digital pins which allow easier
// navigation of the tuning options rather than using key combinations.

// This is for the white Adafruit 1.3" 126 x 64 monochrome OLED screen

// Bug fixed so can still play it using big button if motor totally fails i.e.
// is in effect disconnected OR if keybox is disconnected from soundbox in the
// case of the DigiNerdyGurdy

// Has crank override button, one press for ON next press for OFF instead of
// holding it down all the time.

// On Fluid synth you are using the soundfont viennaaltomod10.sf2 or later
// modified by me to include buzzes of different types and also keyclicks of
// different types. This is a soundfont from the open source Midi-Gurdy project
// at midigurdy.com to which I have just added a few extra sounds, mainly some
// trompette buzzes recorded for me by Nigel Eaton, some keyclick sounds and
// some extra drum and cymbal sounds just for fun if you want the crank to make
// a drum sound instead of a buzz for example.

// SUMMARY OF PINS

// DJ Add Serial/Midiout put via 5 pin midi din socket  Teensy Pin 1 TX to  midi
// pin 5 Teensy 3.3V out to midi pin 4

// Note to self regarding wiring an OLED to an Uno and alternative terminology
// for pins
//   OLED(adafruit)   Arduino UNO    Teensy
//   DATA                D9            D9
//   CLK                 D10           D10
//   D/C                 D11           D11
//   CS                  D12           D12
//   RST                 D13           D13

// Pin15 is also A1 so attach + wire from junction of the crank motor resistor
// pair to Pin 15

// Pin 16 is also A2 so we connect potentiometer wiper for the crank sensitivity
// setting to Pin 16

// Pins for each of the keys are described later
