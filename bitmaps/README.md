## These files aren't used in the digigurdy build

These are the individual xbm files from which the bitmaps in the header files originated.  They are just here for people wanting to modify them to save having to re-extract them from the code.

Also included here are the GIMP XCF files that the bitmaps came from.  With them you can edit the text like I did when I created the bitmaps and match the font/style.
