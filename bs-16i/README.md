These are "Scenes"--their term for presets--for the bs-16i iOS app that is often used for the DigiGurdy.  As far as I can tell, you can manually share them like this... it works between my i-devices.

In your iCloud storage, or somewehre in your Files is a `bs-16i` folder, and in it is a `Scenes` folder.  Put these there and they should show up.

* The "Equal" Scene is just a basic setup I use for D/G gurdy playing.
* The "Microtuned" one uses MIDI channel scale tuning to purposely tune the strings up to 10 cents off from each other, and the notes on the chanters themselves also vary 0-2 cents from each other.  This is to mimic the natural overtones you'd hear on a real hurdy gurdy that isn't digitally in perfect tune.  Try it!  I think it's more realistic, and you can better make out the "strings".

Both of these expect to find my soundfonts.  As long as you have the one John Dingley gives out with the DigiGurdy, that's all it actually uses.  That soundfont is also hosted in this repository.
